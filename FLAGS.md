# Regex Flags Explained

When working with regular expressions, flags are crucial for controlling how the regex is processed and matched against strings. Hereâ€™s a quick overview of common regex flags and their usage:

## Flags Overview

- **`i` - Case-Insensitive Matching**
  - **Purpose**: Allows the regex to match characters regardless of their case.
  - **Usage**: `const regex = /pattern/i;`
  - **Example**: `/hello/i` matches both "hello" and "HELLO".

- **`g` - Global Matching**
  - **Purpose**: Ensures that the regex matches all occurrences within the string, not just the first.
  - **Usage**: `const regex = /pattern/g;`
  - **Example**: `/foo/g` finds all instances of "foo" in a string.

- **`m` - Multiline Mode**
  - **Purpose**: Changes the behavior of `^` and `$` so they match the start and end of each line, not just the start and end of the string.
  - **Usage**: `const regex = /pattern/m;`
  - **Example**: `/^foo/m` matches "foo" at the start of any line in a multiline string.

- **`u` - Unicode Matching**
  - **Purpose**: Enables full Unicode matching, allowing for matching of Unicode characters.
  - **Usage**: `const regex = /pattern/u;`
  - **Example**: `/\u{1F600}/u` matches the ðŸ˜€ emoji.

- **`y` - Sticky Mode**
  - **Purpose**: Ensures the regex matches only from the exact position in the string where it was last matched.
  - **Usage**: `const regex = /pattern/y;`
  - **Example**: `/foo/y` matches "foo" only if it occurs at the last matched position.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s how you can use these flags in the `setFlags` method of the `RegexGenerator` class:

```javascript
const reg = new RegexGenerator();
reg.setFlags({ caseInsensitive: true, global: true });
// This sets the regex to be case-insensitive and global.
```

Each flag modifies how the regex engine performs matching, and combining them allows for powerful and flexible pattern matching.
